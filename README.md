# Clerk Expo Starter

This starter project shows how to use [Clerk](https://www.clerk.dev/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=starter_repos&utm_campaign=expo_starter) with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) to authenticate users in your [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) application. When users sign up or sign in, Clerk handles the state of the authentication and renders public or [protected routes](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/auth-flow).
